<h1>Bio</h1>
I am a Drupal web developer having skills with front and backend development. I am currently looking for remote contract opportunities. I have worked on multi web based projects. I am proficient in all aspect of drupal including installation, maintenance, updates, troubleshooting, custom module, theme development, SEO, data entry, coding standards, patches, security and documentation. I have other skills apart from drupal which include custom PHP, Html5, CSS3 and Adobe Photoshop.
I am a good communicator and am very experienced working with clients in different time zones and locations, I am organized, adaptable, work well under pressure, learn quickly, keep to deadlines and am equally at ease working alone or as part of a team. 


Thanks!
